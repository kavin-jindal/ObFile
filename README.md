ObFile is a python compiler and obfuscator for Windows. It can compile your python programs into exe and you can even add your own custom icons to it. You can obfuscate your python scripts as well. 

ObFile uses **PYINSTALLER** and **PYARMOR** to compile and obfuscate the python files. The credit also goes to the developers of both of these modules.
